    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
      Creme brulee is a French dessert featuring a rich, creamy vanilla custard base topped with a layer of hardened caramelized sugar, creating a contrasting texture of smooth custard and crunchy
      caramel.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
      <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Move an oven rack to the lowest position.</li>
      <li>
        Whisk egg yolks, 1/4 white sugar, and vanilla together in a heatproof bowl until smooth. Bring cream just to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat; gradually whisk hot cream into egg
        yolk mixture (a little at a time to prevent the mixture from scrambling), whisking continuously until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a couple of inches of water to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat; set the bowl with cream mixture over the saucepan to form a double boiler. Cook, gently stirring with a wooden
        spoon, until cream mixture thickens enough to easily coat the back of the spoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour hot cream into a heat-proof baking dish or individual ramekins set on a rimmed baking sheet. Place in the preheated oven; bake until mixture sets but has a slight jiggle, about 20 to 30
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
      <li>
        To make the topping: Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Combine 2 tablespoons white sugar and brown sugar in a small bowl; sprinkle evenly
        over cold creme brulee.
      </li>
      <li>Heat under the preheated broiler until sugar melts and browns, 2 to 3 minutes; return immediately to the refrigerator and chill until sugar is set, about 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
