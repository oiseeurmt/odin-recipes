    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
      Horchata, a sweet cinnamon drink popular throughout Latin America, is typically made by soaking white rice in water, straining through a fine-mesh sieve to eliminate solids, if desired, then
      sweetening the liquid with sugar and cinnamon.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups uncooked long-grain white rice</li>
      <li>1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/2 gallon whole milk</li>
      <li>2 cups cold brew concentrate or espresso, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Add the rice and 21/2 cups water to a large container and cover. Soak at room temperature for a minimum of 8 hours.</li>
      <li>
        Pour the rice and soaking liquid into a blender, and blend until all the rice is finely ground, 2 to 3 minutes. Add condensed milk, nutmeg and cinnamon; blend until combined. Pour the mixture
        into a large pitcher or bowl. Add the whole milk and whisk until incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>To serve, divide horchata among ice-filled glasses and top with cold brew concentrate, to taste (about 2 to 3 tablespoons cold brew for each cup of horchata).</li>
    </ol>
